            <h2>Our Story</h2>

            <p>Sprout & Grow began as a simple backyard project, ust a handful of seedlings, a borrowed potting bench, and a desire to help neighbors grow healthy, vibrant gardens. What started as weekend workshops and friendly plant swaps has since blossomed into Raleigh's trusted local source for organic plants and gardening support.</p>

            <p>While we've grown over the years, our heart hasn't changed. We're still here to inspire curiosity, share knowledge, and help every gardener—no matter their space or experience level—discover the joy of watching something thrive under their care.</p>
